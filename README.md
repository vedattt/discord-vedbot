# VedBot, *a (private) discord.js bot*

VedBot is a private Discord bot developed to cover the needs of a few servers I am a part of.

The project had started out as a single-file JavaScript project built using the discord.js library, but has gone through quite a bit of refactoring since then. Namely;

1- The code was split into proper "modules" and "commands" rather than being contained in a single gigantic file.
2- Later on, the project was migrated over to TypeScript. The migration, initially being more of a pain than imagined, has made the codebase much more reliable thanks to the excruciating work put into it.
3- And at last, the project was upgraded to take advantage of Discord API v9 with the release of discord.js v13.

## `config.json`

All of the configuration is contained within this one file, and it is naturally quite vital to the function of the bot. However, due to its privacy-sensitive contents, it is not publicly available.

## Usage

The project can be used with the scripts included under the `package.json` file.
I handle the deployment using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) personally, which is configured in the `ecosystem.config.js` file.

> Note: Node.js version >= 16.6.0 is required for the discord.js module.

## To do

- [ ] Add role commands for the CS server
- [ ] Mizyaz module needs to be less destructive with its handling of messages
- [ ] The reaction role picker needs an overhaul
- [ ] atpics module needs a command to self-set pics, and also should support non-discord-cdn links if possible
- [ ] guildjoinleave module should tag relevant users without sending them a mention?
- [x] Add readme and license files
